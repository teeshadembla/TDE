      <p>When Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 mark in December 2024, headlines focused on the price surge. But beneath the market excitement, a deeper shift was underway—accelerated by a landmark executive order establishing a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. According to a new report by The Digital Economist, <em>Blockchain & Digital Assets Industry Outlook 2025–26</em>, blockchain is no longer a speculative side bet—it’s being built into the core of national and financial infrastructure.</p>

      <p>Spanning over 50 pages, the report is the result of forty–four interviews with industry executives, legal experts, and regulators across jurisdictions. The findings point to a digital asset landscape that’s no longer waiting for mainstream acceptance—it’s already in motion.</p>

      <p>“The blockchain industry has moved from ‘if’ to ‘when’ regarding mainstream adoption,” says Dr. Nikhil Varma, Blockchain & Digital Assets Chair at The Digital Economist.</p>

      <h2>From Fringe to Foundation</h2>

      <p>Once criticized as slow, costly, and unproven, blockchain infrastructure is now being deployed at scale. Major financial institutions are leading the charge: JPMorgan and BlackRock are weaving modular blockchain frameworks into their core systems. BlackRock, for example, recently completed a live transaction with Barclays using tokenized fund shares as collateral—a move that underlines how far tokenization has moved from theory to practice.</p>

      <p>These developments are built on architectural breakthroughs like modularity and interoperability—now recognized as foundational pillars of next–gen digital infrastructure.</p>

      <p>Governments, too, are stepping in—not with knee–jerk enforcement but with structured policy. Regulatory chaos that once stalled innovation is giving way to alignment. The European Union's MiCA framework has become a reference point, and in the US, the agenda has shifted toward building a regulatory architecture rather than simply cracking down. The momentum is picking up—56 percent of countries are on track to align with the FSB’s global framework this year. The report projects that by the end of 2025, more than half of the world's countries will have adopted or aligned with global blockchain standards. Still, the US and EU might take different paths forward, which shows we’re not quite at the finish line yet.</p>

      <h2>Beyond Currency: Real–World Applications Take Shape</h2>

      <p>While blockchain’s early chapters were dominated by cryptocurrency, its next act is decidedly more diverse. DePIN represents a growing movement to integrate blockchain into physical infrastructure—from peer–to–peer energy trading and communications networks to smart cities and decentralized supply chains.</p>

      <p>In Brooklyn, residents are now trading solar energy via a blockchain–enabled microgrid. Globally, more than $4 billion worth of real estate has changed hands on blockchain platforms. Meanwhile, China’s digital yuan has already processed transactions exceeding $5 billion.</p>

      <p>The rise of stablecoins has also caught the attention of both humanitarian groups and central banks. Once viewed as volatile or opaque, stablecoins are increasingly being used in cross–border payments and disaster relief. The United Nations World Food Programme now uses stablecoins to deliver aid to over a million refugees.</p>

      <p>Stablecoins—whether fiat–collateralized, crypto–backed, or algorithmic—are maturing fast. Tether, for instance, is now in talks with a Big Four audit firm to bolster its reserve transparency, a sign of the ecosystem’s drive toward institutional trust.</p>

      <h2>CBDCs and the Future of Monetary Policy</h2>

      <p>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are another major theme. From China’s digital yuan to India’s digital rupee and the EU’s upcoming digital euro, these state–backed currencies are no longer pilots—they’re part of a broader strategy to modernize monetary systems. Each reflects different national goals: financial inclusion in India, privacy and sovereignty in Europe, and economic control in China. But the signal is clear: digital currency is becoming a key instrument of twenty–first–century statecraft.</p>

      <h2>The Road Ahead: AI, Tokenization, and Institutional Capital</h2>

      <p>The report also looks ahead. It sees a future shaped by the convergence of blockchain and artificial intelligence, a growing share of tokenized assets, and regulatory clarity that could pull in even more institutional money. Citigroup estimates that tokenization could grow into a $4–5 trillion market by 2030, spanning everything from stocks and bonds to real estate and intellectual property.</p>

      <p>With the rise of AI integration and quantum–resistant technologies, the next wave of blockchain infrastructure is being designed not just for speed but for future–proof security.</p>

      <p>Consumer–facing blockchain platforms are also gaining traction. Music and publishing platforms like Audius and Mirror allow creators to bypass intermediaries while collectibles like NBA Top Shot have crossed the billion–dollar sales mark. It’s a new kind of creator economy—built on–chain and increasingly mainstream.</p>

      <h2>A New Financial Infrastructure, Already Underway</h2>

      <p>What emerges from the <em>Blockchain & Digital Assets Industry Outlook 2025–26</em> is a clear message: the future isn’t waiting for blockchain—it’s already being built with it. As governments begin to hold Bitcoin reserves, and banks route billions through blockchain networks, the transformation is less a question of <em>if</em> than <em>how fast</em>.</p>

      <p>Whether the public fully realizes it yet or not, the financial world is changing—and blockchain is no longer on the outside looking in.</p>

    <p>We’re spending enormous energy right now debating the future of artificial intelligence, the ethics of algorithmic decision–making, and how to design trustworthy digital systems. We’re tackling climate change with bold commitments, policy frameworks, and cross–sector financing models. We’re discussing misinformation as an existential threat to democracy. And we’re wringing our hands about the erosion of public trust.</p>

    <p>But all of these conversations—each of them important—often skip over something even more foundational. We don’t talk nearly enough about violence against women.</p>

    <p>Not in Davos. Not at the UN General Assembly. Not even in the AI ethics community, where “trust” and “bias” dominate the discourse.</p>

    <p>Yet this is the crisis that underlies them all.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters Now</h2>

    <p>If we’re serious about building human–centered systems—systems that reflect dignity, interdependence, and justice—we have to look at the actual conditions under which half the world’s population lives.</p>
    <p>Behind algorithmic bias lies centuries of gendered power dynamics. Behind climate vulnerability lies the fact that women and girls are often the first to suffer and the last to recover. Behind every trust crisis in institutions lies a pattern of silencing survivors and protecting abusers.</p>

    <p>To ignore this is not just a moral failure—it’s a design flaw.</p>

    <h2>The Data We Refuse to Look At</h2>

    <p>The statistics are staggering, and yet they’re routinely ignored in professional settings—especially ones like LinkedIn that prize positivity and career polish. But silence helps no one.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Globally, nearly 1 in 3 women have experienced physical or sexual violence, most often by an intimate partner</li>
      <li>In 2023 alone, more than 51,000 women and girls were killed by family members—140 lives lost every day</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Even in the most advanced economies, systemic abuse—psychological, economic, and institutional—remains largely unaddressed. And most survivors never report it.</p>

    <p>This is not a side issue. It is the terrain on which all other systemic problems are built.</p>

    <h2>What This Means for Human–Centered Design</h2>

    <p>Human–centered systems, as we define them at <strong>The Digital Economist</strong>, are not just about better UI or inclusive data sets. They are about power, participation, and protection.</p>

    <p>This is why we’ve spent years designing governance frameworks that center these principles—especially in fragile, emerging, or digitally transforming economies.</p>

    <p>With <strong>The World Bank Group</strong>, we’ve supported the development of national <strong>GovTech strategies</strong> that explicitly address gender gaps in digital access, public service delivery, and leadership—designing governance systems that center equity, build trust, and ensure that digital transformation uplifts rather than excludes, as emphasized in the latest work on <strong>GovTech and gender equity</strong>.</p>

    <p>With numerous leading global organizations, we’ve supported initiatives that redefine women’s roles in executive leadership—not by “empowerment” rhetoric alone, but by changing the incentives, policies, and structures that have kept women excluded, underpaid, and unheard.</p>

    <p>And in our <strong>policy work on climate resilience</strong>, we’ve advocated for a new social contract—one that extends the UN’s “Responsibility to Protect” to climate and digital governance, recognizing that without human security for all, there is no sustainable future.</p>

    <h2>The Economic Case for Justice</h2>

    <p>The gender gap isn’t just a human rights issue—it’s an economic crisis.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A 2018 World Bank report estimated that bringing women’s earnings up to male levels would add $160 trillion to global wealth (<strong>World Bank</strong>).</li>
      <li>The US economy alone could grow by 8.7% if women had equal labor force participation; Japan by 14%; France by 17%.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So when we talk about innovation, growth, or resilience without addressing gender–based violence and exclusion, we’re not just being unjust—we’re being economically irrational.</p>

    <h2>A Deeper Reckoning Is Overdue</h2>

    <p>We can’t build trustworthy AI systems on top of cultures that dismiss women’s pain. We can’t build climate resilience in a world that keeps women out of decision–making. We can’t claim to be ethical designers, investors, or leaders if we ignore the most widespread, normalized form of violence on the planet.</p>

    <p>To those working on AI ethics, climate finance, digital identity, or institutional trust: <strong>Start here.</strong> This is where human–centered design begins—not with the interface, but with what we choose to see, name, and act upon.</p>

    <h2>Let’s Build What Matters</h2>

    <p>At <strong>The Digital Economist</strong>, we will continue to challenge extractive systems and co–create a future where inclusion is not an afterthought—but a starting point.</p>

    <p>Our work won’t stop at naming the crisis. We’re here to rewire the system.</p>

    title: "AI for Power or Progress? A Human-Centered Response to America’s AI Action Plan",
    publishingDate: "July 28, 2025",
    thumbnailUrl: "https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/685269b5ec19fa449f15ae3c/68b0b7301bc93acdfd41b69e_AI%20for%20Power%20or%20Progress.avif",
    content: `<p>The release of <em>America’s AI Action Plan</em> marks a watershed moment in global technology policy. With its sweeping ambition, the plan boldly stakes the United States’ claim in the race for AI dominance—prioritizing innovation, infrastructure, and geopolitics. But beneath the powerful rhetoric of progress lies a deeper question: <em>What kind of future are we racing toward?</em></p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.thedigitaleconomist.com" target="_blank">The Digital Economist</a>, we believe in shaping not only the tools of tomorrow but also the values that govern their use. Our mission—anchored in a human-centered economy—asks us to consider whether accelerating AI should come at the expense of equity, sustainability, or truth. As I read the plan, I’m reminded of why institutions like ours must remain steadfast in our commitment to responsibility, systems-level thinking, and shared prosperity.</p>

<h2>What We Welcome</h2>

<p>There are parts of the plan we can align with. Investments in workforce transformation, AI literacy, and scientific research signal that technology can and should empower people. The emphasis on AI adoption in critical sectors like healthcare and manufacturing is overdue. And the push to create open-source ecosystems and transparent AI evaluations could help build the trust AI so desperately needs.</p>

<p>These are building blocks—what we at <a href="https://www.thedigitaleconomist.com" target="_blank">The Digital Economist</a> call the "intelligence infrastructure" of the future economy.</p>

<h2>What Gives Us Pause</h2>

<p>But let us be clear: <em>America’s AI Action Plan is not neutral.</em></p>

<p>The wholesale removal of guardrails—such as ethical constraints around bias, misinformation, climate impact, and inclusion—risks creating a brittle and extractive AI landscape. Deregulation is framed as a patriotic act, but at what cost? When references to diversity, equity, or the environment are purged from national standards, we are not clearing red tape—we are abandoning responsibility.</p>

<p>The plan’s vision of “objective” AI dangerously ignores the fact that data is never neutral, and models reflect societal patterns—including discrimination and exclusion. By stripping away this nuance, the plan invites a false binary between innovation and ethics. At <a href="https://www.thedigitaleconomist.com" target="_blank">The Digital Economist</a>, we reject this framing.</p>

<h2>The Missing Pillar: Governance</h2>

<p>Where this plan falls short is in its near-total absence of bottom-up, democratic governance. There is no meaningful engagement with communities impacted by AI, no mechanisms for accountability, no focus on global ethical frameworks. In international fora, the emphasis is on exporting U.S. tech—rather than co-creating interoperable, inclusive standards.</p>

<p>It assumes leadership through control, not collaboration. But sustainable leadership in the AI age will depend on legitimacy, not just leverage.</p>

<h2>Our Position: Tech for Human Dignity</h2>

<p>We urge policymakers, innovators, and business leaders to view this moment not as a race for supremacy—but as a turning point in how we redefine intelligence itself. True progress is measured not by compute capacity or data center acreage, but by how technology uplifts the human condition.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thedigitaleconomist.com" target="_blank">The Digital Economist</a> remains committed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Designing equitable AI systems that work for everyone</li>
  <li>Upholding transparency and interpretability, not only performance</li>
  <li>Embedding ethical reflection into every phase of AI development</li>
  <li>Building shared global standards rooted in justice, not just competitiveness</li>
</ul>

<p>We will continue convening, educating, and supporting leaders who share our belief: <em>AI must serve the whole of humanity—not just its most powerful actors.</em></p>

<h2>A Final Word</h2>

<p>The U.S. may win the AI race. But the real question is—<em>will we also win the peace, the dignity, and the trust that define leadership in the 21st century?</em></p>

<p>Let’s not confuse acceleration with direction. At <a href="https://www.thedigitaleconomist.com" target="_blank">The Digital Economist</a>, we choose the harder path: one that centers people, planet, and purpose.</p>`,

    publishingDate: "July 30, 2025",
    thumbnailUrl: "https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/685269b5ec19fa449f15ae3c/689c891c7c9020f4094c7c39_News%20Thumbnail%20Presentation-p-1600.jpg",

<article>
  <p><strong>From CEO desk, July 30, 2025</strong> — As New York City prepares to host over 900 climate-related events during Climate Week NYC and the <a href="https://www.un.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Nations</a> General Assembly High-Level Week this September, the global community finds itself at a moment of profound contradiction—and enormous possibility.</p>

  <p>On one hand, we are witnessing an unprecedented rollback of federal climate leadership from the United States. On the other, the rest of the world is not slowing down. If anything, the urgency to act—and to act collaboratively—has never been clearer.</p>

  <p>At <a href="https://www.thedigitaleconomist.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Digital Economist</a>, we believe this is precisely the kind of moment when systems thinkers, governance innovators, and practitioners of global cooperation must step forward. Not to react—but to lead.</p>

  <h2>A Fractured Landscape</h2>

  <p>Since January 2025, the Trump administration has enacted sweeping reversals on environmental and scientific policy. These include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The U.S. exit from the Paris Agreement</li>
    <li>The dismantling of climate science infrastructure, including layoffs across <a href="https://www.noaa.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NOAA: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> and the <a href="https://www.epa.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a></li>
    <li>The rollback of power plant and methane emissions standards</li>
    <li>The removal of the National Climate Assessment from public access</li>
    <li>And most recently, the announcement that the U.S. will once again withdraw from <a href="https://en.unesco.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNESCO</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>In parallel, the U.S. formally rejected the <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Court of Justice (ICJ)</a> recent advisory opinion, which declared climate inaction a violation of human rights. The opinion marked a global milestone, affirming that climate denial carries legal consequences. But Washington’s response was clear: the U.S. does not intend to participate in this new international legal consensus.</p>

  <h2>But the World Moves</h2>

  <p>Yet while federal power recedes, the world moves forward. Cities, businesses, civil society, and multilateral organizations are not only stepping into the gap—they are reshaping the very contours of global climate governance.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Brazil, as COP30 host, has proposed the creation of a UN Climate Council, along with a $250 billion Tropical Forest Finance Facility.</li>
    <li>The <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Court of Justice (ICJ)</a> ruling is already shaping dialogue around enforceable climate obligations and international reparations.</li>
    <li>Carbon markets, ESG standards, and digital platforms for climate finance transparency are rapidly scaling across borders.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These developments are not symbolic. They are structural. They represent the evolution of planetary governance in real time.</p>

  <h2>Our Role: Frame the Future</h2>

  <p>The mission of <a href="https://www.thedigitaleconomist.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Digital Economist</a> extends far beyond the political. While U.S. policy may oscillate with election cycles, the stakes of climate breakdown are measured in generations. We operate with a deep understanding that systemic transformation does not depend on who holds office—it depends on who shows up to build coalitions, create frameworks, and take responsibility.</p>

  <p>And this September, we will show up.</p>

  <p>Our team, including over a hundred executive fellows and senior leaders, will be present across key convenings in New York City. We are hosting a side event focused on digital infrastructure for climate accountability and finance flow, in direct alignment with the priorities of COP30.</p>

  <p>Our commitment is clear: to advance solutions that are collaborative, transparent, and globally coherent.</p>

  <h2>What to Watch This September</h2>

  <p>We invite our peers, partners, and community members to focus attention on five signal-rich areas during Climate Week NYC and UNGA:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>COP30-aligned finance mechanisms – particularly Brazil’s tropical forest facility and related Global South-led funding coalitions.</li>
    <li>Climate governance reform – including proposals for a UN Climate Council or alternative enforcement mechanisms.</li>
    <li>The ICJ ruling’s implications – especially its recognition of climate denial as a rights violation.</li>
    <li>Digital climate infrastructure – platforms that enable measurement, reporting, verification, and ESG traceability.</li>
    <li>South-South leadership – events and negotiations led by coalitions outside traditional power centers.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This is where the future of global coordination is being forged.</p>

  <h2>A Message to the Broader Community</h2>

  <p>For those considering whether to attend Climate Week NYC this year—yes, you should come.</p>

  <p>Not to chase headlines or tokens of inclusion, but to take part in something more lasting: the reconstitution of global cooperation around shared environmental responsibility. To contribute meaningfully to systems that can endure. To find your place in a network of people serious about building what comes next. This is not performative policy. This is architecture work—and the scaffolding is going up right now.</p>

  <h2>Join Us</h2>
